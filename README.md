# Reflections 

### 1. Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you wouldâ€™ve approached the design and problem solving process.

        - We were unable to get to iteration 3.  Without having looked at it, white-boarding to sketch out what the next Class might look like would probably be our start since there are a so many running pieces to this complex project. 
        
        - We would break into appropriate classes we could adhere to single responsibility as best as we could.      


### 2. If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?
    - We started with a style of logic on the #valid_placement using square brackets to isolate elements we were looking for and put them into defined variables to use in the actual logic.  While the logic works, iff we had more time we could like to work on incorporating enumerables to return coordinates we were looking for to clean it up more and make it concise.  

### 3. Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.
    - To begin we paired on Zoom and ping-ponged.  This was helpful for both of us to get practice writing tests AND methods while making sure we were using correct git commands.  

    - As coding got more complex, Dana worked solo and with a mentor, and kept Aurora up to date on completed logic.  

    - Aurora was able to pair for a student help appointment in which she was able to ask questions she had as well as bring things back to the group project for us.

    - We also paired together troubleshooting some logic which was helpful for one partner to work the logic while the other was able to keep eyes on syntax mistakes and simple things that are so easy to miss when you're coding solo.  

### 4. Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.
        - We held to the DTR and the times suggested to revisit it.  The two of us were very respectful of requests made, we gave good and kind critical feedback and overall it was a really good experience to be able to work together!
